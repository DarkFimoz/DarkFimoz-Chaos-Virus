## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Run from Source

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the program
python virus.py
```

### Option 2: Build EXE

```bash
# Automatic build (recommended)
install_and_build.bat

# Or manual
pip install pyinstaller
python -m PyInstaller --onefile --noconsole --add-data="sounds.mp3;." virus.py
```

The EXE will be in `dist/` folder.
